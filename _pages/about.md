Hello World!
========
Hello, I am Yifan Zhang, currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.  
My research areas include:  
- Genomics  
- Transcriptomics  
- Epigenetics  
- Bioinformatics Tool Development  

Through interdisciplinary collaboration, I hope to contribute to advancing data analysis techniques and innovative applications in the biomedical field.


Research Interests
========

My research primarily focuses on the following areas: 

QTL Analysis
--------
I study how quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis can reveal the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, particularly how genetic variations affect complex disease susceptibility in different populations.


Methylation Analysis
------
DNA methylation, as an epigenetic modification, can influence gene expression and play an important role in diseases. I focus on how methylation is involved in the early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases like cancer.


Proteomics QTL Analysis (pQTL)
------
Through pQTL analysis, I investigate the relationship between protein expression and genotype, further understanding how genetic regulation impacts protein function.


Data Processing and Algorithm Development 
------
I work on developing efficient data processing tools and algorithms to optimize the analysis workflows for large-scale biological datasets, such as genomic and transcriptomic data, improving the precision and efficiency of data analysis.

The road is long and arduous, but I will persist in seeking knowledge in every direction.  
Let's encourage each other!
